        About Me: <h3><p>My name is Noah Rose, a third-year Creative Technology and Design major at CU Boulder. When I'm not working on school project you can find me playing video games, attempting to make music, and over-stressing about what life may have in store for me next. I own a turtle, two cats, and a parakeet, all named Racecar, Elaina, Lilith, and Burger respectively. One day I hope to either become a game developer or a product designer, and hopefully be able to create video content as a side hobby.</p></h3>
